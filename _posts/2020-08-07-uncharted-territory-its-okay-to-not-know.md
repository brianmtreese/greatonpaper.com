I don’t have the answers.

Why are the loudest voices right now so 100% sure their way is right? And why are they barking their opinions from the rooftops? This goes for all political parties and backgrounds.

I don’t know about you, but nearly all of the things coming up this year are uncharted territory for us. When I say “us,” I mean the humans alive on this Earth right now. The humans currently in government positions; the humans currently running our hospitals and schools.

Yes, there are people alive right now that went through the Spanish Flu (although not many), World War II, and the Great Depression. But are they in a position to shape our decisions as a country? As a local community? No.

#### **This is uncharted territory.**

Can we give grace to those making decisions? It’s got to be an extremely difficult time right now – why is perfection expected?

In my career, we used to say the best leaders admit when they don’t know something; that being honest is how you earn trust. In the tech industry, things are always changing. That means “uncharted territory” becomes the norm, especially in a tech company experiencing rapid growth.

So why aren’t we hearing more honesty from those around us?

Are they afraid to admit they don’t know the best way to move forward? Because unless you’ve experienced any of these things we’re facing right now, there’s no way to be 100% sure your solution is the best way.

#### **It is okay to verbalize that you’re unsure.**

Yet somehow everyone is turning into an expert from their couch.

For the last month (and counting), I’ve taken a break from social media. I just couldn’t “listen” to everyone shouting their expert opinions at each other anymore…it’s too much. And I was feeling pulled into the muck of it, getting wrapped up in other people’s strong opinions.  

But that’s not how I want to spend my time.

There’s a storm of information swirling around us at all times right now. It feels like the options are to 1) contribute to the noise 2) defend your own opinion 3) do nothing.

#### **But there’s a fourth option.**

You can choose to take notice of the news and opinions coming at you and let them fly by. If you’ve ever meditated before, I’m suggesting a similar practice.

Meditation isn’t about squashing your thoughts – it’s about noticing them and letting them continue on, as if they are drifting on a cloud in your mind.

I would like to take this approach.

#### Because this is uncharted territory. And nobody is 100% sure the right thing to do.

P.S. I highly recommend taking a step away from social media. Take a look at your loved ones - your family, yourself - and focus on what you can do to make your own ecosystem better. Worry less about what other people are doing. As my friend Erick says, that focus on your bubble will have a ripple effect of goodness onto those around you.
